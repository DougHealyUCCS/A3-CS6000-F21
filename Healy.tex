\section{Doug Healy}

I starting my second year in work towards my PhD in Engineering Security, studying under Dr. Bloom. I received my Masters in Information Security Policy and Management from Carnegie Mellon in 2013, and my BS in Electrical Engineering Technology back in 2003 from Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT). 

I am a avid and active supporter of Scouts BSA, volunteering much of my time in support of the program, both at the Scout (11 to 18 years old) and Cub Scout (5-11 years old) levels. Being an Eagle Scout myself, I highly believe in the values and qualities it instills in our young men and women and work very hard to make the programs successful and FUN!  

For this course, I hope to become more efficient in my research. I have spent many, many hours over the summer pouring over search results from both Google Scholar and the UCCS Library. I want to learn how to hone search results, use the correct resources, to efficiently find what I am actually looking for, not what some search engine "thinks" I am looking for. This will also require me to refine how I choose my search terms.  

Secondly, I want to learn how to effectively learn to use my time in reading a scholarly document. I am not a good "skimmer" of documents or books; never have been. I want to learn how to do this more effectively and to make sure I am not missing anything. I always think I am missing important things on the page, and I want to ensure that through my skimming, I am not.
